        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning technique used to understand the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y). It assumes that the relationship between X and Y can be represented using a straight line. The main purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on a given value of the independent variable and to measure how changes in X affect Y."
